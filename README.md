# Dynamically DropDown:The objective of this project is to develop a dynamic dropdown system that allows users to select a country, upon which the corresponding states are populated in the second dropdown. Once a state is selected, the third dropdown is populated with cities relevant to that state. This cascading dropdown mechanism enhances user experience by displaying only relevant data at each step, reducing errors and improving form usability. The project involves the use of front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the user interface and back-end technologies (such as ASP.NET, or Node.js) with a database (like MySQL, SQL Server) to store and retrieve country, state, and city data dynamically using AJAX.
